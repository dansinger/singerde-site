          I love the internet. 
        </p>
        <p>
          from the first time I used home dial-up in the 3rd grade to write a dinosaur report, I was hooked.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiasaura" target="_blank">ü¶ï</a> 
        </p>
        <p>for me, that wired, tenuous connection allowed me to try on a self on fan forums and in games that was more confident. it taught me to cultivate my curiosity and value learning beyond the confines of what was in front of me. I noticed how it brought people together based on commonalities in ways that could never otherwise happen.  
        </p> 
        <p>
          and as I've grown alongside the internet, I've seen the ways in which it has enabled toxic relationships with one another and with ourselves. as a tech professional, I've been interested in the ways in which design (or anti-design) shapes the interactions that we're able to have. that has driven me to get curious about the ways we can positively impact those forces.

        I am a chronic over-thinker and unstoppable busybody, which drove me to study <strong>anthropology</strong>. I fused that with my love of music and performance to study <strong>ethnomusicology</strong> at Boston University, where I studied ethnograpy and a compliment of qualitative methods. 
      </p>
      <h3>M.A., Ethnomusicology / Boston University (2014)</h3>
      <h3>B.A.. Anthropology, magna cum laude / James Madison University (2012)</h3>
      <h3>Graduate Questionnaire Design coursework / UMich: Summer Institute in Survey Techniques (2021)</h3>

        I live with my partner and cats in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" target="_blank">Philadelphia, PA, USA</a>, a small big city which we have come to love. I spend many nights cooking, pulling ingredients from a pantry I've overstocked with random spices.

        I practice traditional kintsugi, the Japanese art of mending broken ceramics with lacquer. I share some of my work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sparrow_kintsugi" target="_blank">instagram</a>.

        storytelling has been a constant for me, and what once lived only in daydreams I've learned to channel into tabletop gaming with my friends. I like to call myself a "game weaver" instead of a dungeon master, working to string together many loose threads of magic and mechanics into an enjoyable experience<a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/PlainAlivePangolinTBCheesePull?tt_medium=my_clips" target="_blank">.</a>
